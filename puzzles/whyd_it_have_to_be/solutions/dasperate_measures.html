<h1>solution: dasperate measures</h1>
<div style="text-align: center">
<h2>answer: <span class="spoiler">aeon</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="solution">
<p>based on the words "ascending" and "descending", solvers should hopefully think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascender_(typography)">ascenders</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descender">descenders</a> in typography. each note is a single letter - a note with no stem is one of <code>acemnorsuvwxz</code>, a note with a stem facing up is one of <code>bdfiklt</code>, and a note with a steam facing downards is one of <code>gpqy</code> (the letter <code>j</code> is omitted to avoid any ambiguity). additionally, each measure gives a single word.</p>
<p>by poking at a few of the more suspicious words/phrases, solvers should then be able to piece together crossword clues for each row. Each clue solves for a word with as many letters as there are measures in the row. additionally, once a few words have been found, searching for all of them together should result in the discovery that these are all units of measurement.</p>
<p>as each row has one measure that is just a rest and the number of letters in each answer lines up with the measures, solvers should extract those letters.</p>
