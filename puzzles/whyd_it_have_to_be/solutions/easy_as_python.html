<p>Solvers should start by solving the crossword clues. After looking at a few and considering the title and flavor text, they should realize that each answer can have a single letter removed to make a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords">Python keyword</a>.</p>
<table class="solTable">

<p>Reading the extra letters in order gives the clue <code>CITRUS RIND</code> - along with the enumeration at the bottom, this clues <span style="color: green">ORANGE PEEL</span>.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>I realize it's a bit confusing to have the enumerations of both the final clue and the final answer be (6 4) - this hopefully helped more than it hurt, though if I had to do it again I might reconsider <code>(6 4) -> (6 4)</code> or similar. The underlying dataset is sadly fairly constrained beyond what is seen here.</p>
