# Curve Tapa

This is a [Curve Data](https://puzz.link/rules.html?curvedata) puzzle but instead of any symbols being given, four [Tapa](https://puzz.link/rules.html?tapa)s must be solved. Figuring out where the symbols need to be placed on the board is left to the solver.  
**NOTE** This puzzle is one of the first I made does not have a very clean solve path.
